# Befunge

[Befunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge) is an esoteric programming language.
While most languages specify their program as lines of text, read one by one and executed, Befunge is a little different.
Programs are written as a 2D grid of characters, which becomes the program itself. 
One can use the "arrow" operators to control how the program is read, either left, right, up, or down. 
The 2D grid can also be modifed at runtime, creating the possibility for self-modifying code.

This is an interpreter for Befunge code, written in Java.

Please view the tests for instructions on how to execute a Befunge program and get output.
